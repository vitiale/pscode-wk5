// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number % 2 == 0 then
    Output number, "is even"
else
    Output number, "is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

sum = 0
min = 0
max = 0

for i = 1 to 5 do
    Input number
    sum = sum + number
    
    // Minimum ************
    if number < min then
        min = number
    
    // Maximum  *************
    if number > max then
        max = number

// Average
average = sum / 5

// Output the results
Output "The average of the five numbers is", average
Output "The minimum number is", min
Output "The maximum number is", max
